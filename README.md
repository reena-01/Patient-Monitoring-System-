# PATIENT MONITORING
The Patient Monitoring System is used to update the vital details of the patients such as the glucose level, pressure, heart rate, temperature, etc. to the doctors regularly Using IoT the readings measured by the heartbeat sensor, the temperature is made to reach the doctors' database as well as to the attenders’ database. If any problem arises with the patients’ health, the system will give an alert to the doctors. So, it will gradually decrease the death rates of the patients who are at their respective homes. 
The patient monitoring system is designed in a way that it can include one or more devices to it.

Parameters:

>> The LM35 device has an advantage over linear temperature sensors calibrated in Kelvin, as the user is not required to subtract a large constant voltage from the output to obtain conveniently Centigrade scaling.



>> Heartbeat sensor digital output can be connected to the microcontroller directly to measure the Beats Per Minute (BPM) rate. It works on the principle of light modulation by blood flow through the finger at each pulse.

THIS MAY BE HELPFUL  IF SEEKING TO IMPOVE THE SOURCE OF PARAMETERS
